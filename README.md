# Movies-ETL
## Overview of the project
The purpose of this project was to create a automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data into existing tables. As a result, one function is created that takes in the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL(Extract, Transform, Load) process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.
